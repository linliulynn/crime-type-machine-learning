# crime-type-machine-learning
analysis crime type in Chicago with random forest and deep neural network

dataAnalysis.py is the program for data preprocessing and the preprocessing results are saved in a csv file(selected_features_2012-to-2017).

randomForest.py contains the model for random forest prediction, confusion matrix, classification report and 
                plot code for normalized and unnormalized confusion matrix. And gradient boosting trees is another model in it.

neuralNetwork.py contains the model for neural network without dense embeddings, confusion matrix, classification report and 
                    plot code for confusion matrix.

NeuralNetworkwithDense.py contains the model for neural network with dense embeddings, confusion matrix, classification report and 
                    plot code for confusion matrix.
